		<strong>History</strong><br>		
		Mercury Drug began from a bottle of sulfathiazole, which was considered a wonder drug after the war.
		It was 1945, and Manila had just been liberated from the Japanese occupation. The city was devastated
		and medicines were scarce and expensive. Mariano Que, who worked in a drugstore before the war, saw the need.
		He went to Bambang St., Manila, where the action was then, on advice of a friend, and saw a peddler selling
		sulfathiazole there. He recognized it as the 'wonder drug' believed to cure all diseases. Seeing a 'W' on the tablets,
		he knew it was the genuine sulfathiazole. He tried to buy a bottle for P100, the only money in his pocket.

        Why Check Blood Pressure?
		First and foremorst, it's a measure of maintenance. Ideally, we should keep away from high blood pressure as much as possible 
		as it could develop into more serious issues over time. Someone who has thick, narrow artieries (as those with high blood 
		pressure do) are more susceptible to clots, which in turn can cause an episode of a heart attack, a stroke, or even long-term 
		diseases such as kidney issues or dementia.
