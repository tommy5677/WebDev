		<strong>Why Go For a Checkup</strong><br>
		While this minor medical procedure may seem inconsequential, recognize the importance of being able to detect
		a possible ailment before it even starts. Check-ups are pre-emptive measures taken by those who want to ensure
		that their bodily functions are performing normally - which, of course, is a great indicator of one's health.
		 Through the years, Mercury Drug has opened store 
				after store all over the Philippines to bring medicines within easy reach of its customers. Today, it has grown 
				into a vast network of more than 1,000 stores nationwide with over 14,000 employees,<br>
		<strong>How Many Times Do I Have to Go?</strong><br>
		There's no set amount. Go whenever you can, though people usually average at around 3 to 4 times per year. It also depends
		on your age; babies and toddlers have to go more often - sometimes up to 10 times a year - whilst those in their teenage years
		to the young adult stages barely manage 3 annually.

        Why Check Blood Pressure?
		First and foremorst, it's a measure of maintenance. Ideally, we should keep away from high blood pressure as much as possible 
		as it could develop into more serious issues over time. Someone who has thick, narrow artieries (as those with high blood 
		pressure do) are more susceptible to clots, which in turn can cause an episode of a heart attack, a stroke, or even long-term 
		diseases such as kidney issues or dementia.
