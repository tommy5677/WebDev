		<strong>Infanrix hexa</strong><br>
		protects against hepatitis B in addition to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, 
		and Haemophilus influenzae type b. It is now available to order on ImmForm.<br>
		As summarised in the MIMS routine vaccination table, Infanrix hexa should be given to infants 
		born on or after 1 August 2017 at 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks. Infants born before 1 August 2017 
		should receive Pediacel or Infanrix-IPV+Hib to initiate or complete their vaccination course.
		Babies born on or after 1 August 2017 to mothers with hepatitis B will still require a dose of monovalent 
		vaccine immediately after birth and at 4 weeks of age and should then follow the routine schedule with 
		hexavalent vaccine (at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age). They will require a further dose of monovalent 
		hepatitis B vaccine at one year of age and should be tested to exclude infection at the same time.
		A further dose of hepatitis B-containing vaccine at 3 years and 4 months is no longer recommended 
		for children who have completed their routine primary immunisations with the hexavalent hepatitis B-containing vaccine.

        Why Check Blood Pressure?
		First and foremorst, it's a measure of maintenance. Ideally, we should keep away from high blood pressure as much as possible 
		as it could develop into more serious issues over time. Someone who has thick, narrow artieries (as those with high blood 
		pressure do) are more susceptible to clots, which in turn can cause an episode of a heart attack, a stroke, or even long-term 
		diseases such as kidney issues or dementia.
