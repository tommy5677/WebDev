        Why Check Blood Pressure?
		First and foremorst, it's a measure of maintenance. Ideally, we should keep away from high blood pressure as much as possible 
		as it could develop into more serious issues over time. Someone who has thick, narrow artieries (as those with high blood 
		pressure do) are more susceptible to clots, which in turn can cause an episode of a heart attack, a stroke, or even long-term 
		diseases such as kidney issues or dementia.
		See a Doctor Often

		Our health is one of the most important things we should be taking care of, seeing as it will dictate what we can and cannot do on a daily basis. If we take care of ourselves, then we're likely to perform better in our daily tasks. Otherwise, if we neglect our bodily needs, we tend to slowly weaken - even if we don't notice it at first.
